# Like Bluesky Profile Posts

 I have created a software on the Bluesky platform that, given a username, first lists all of their posts and then likes all of them. It can list and like up to a maximum of 100 posts.

 Install atproto for python
 ```
pip install atproto
```

Edit the username and password on line 15 of the code line according to you.
 ```python
agent.login('bluesky-handle', 'bluesky-password')
```

Run command
 ```
py like.py
```
